#To Do List Project for The Odin Projects

Hey you beautiful people, thanks for having a time to take a peek at this project

So, this is a simple note takers to do list page.
You can take a note, write a description, set a date, and check/uncheck the note or delete it.
also it will be saved automatically in your browser storage! pretty neat right?

I started doing this by creating the base of the project as someone said "creating a project should be like building a house from inside out". I made the base code to works by command line then I worked my way out from there. Also I tried to apply SOLID principle in this project as much as I can, even though I may broke couple of rules here and there :)

The main challenge of this project was to actually nailed the localStorage function, as for me it was a bit confusing to update the local storage everytime there is an update on the note,  whether the note is checked/unchecked, deleted, refresh page, or changed project storage. Although it is not perfect clean code, I am satisfied with the internal code in this project and so far no bugs detected (let me know if it has one!)

This is also the first time I use Linting & beautify in my code.
I use ESLint (airBnB standard) and PRETTIER. I can tell that they are very useful!

So thank you and see you in the next project


best regards,
